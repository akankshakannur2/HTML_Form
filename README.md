# HTML_Form
This is a basic project using HTML. In this I have created an EMPLOYEE DETAIL FORM using HTML. After creating this form only using HTML I understand that HTML is not as easy as we see.
This project needs smart and logical way of thinking and it includes the use and application of simple tag porperties of HTML.
As this is a static html webpage, it is only viewable to large screens. 
Will not responsive to mobile screens or small screen.
